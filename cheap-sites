For the first flag, we sent a request after solving the math problem manually, and then just modified the time variable to be set to 0, which returned the first flag. For the second flag, we sent a getAdminPassword request with the type parameter set to email, which returned the second flag in the response. For the third flag, we utilized the fact that the grantAdmin script sends an error message with whatever environment variable is specified by the request, so by specifying the third flag env variable name as the parameter and then sending a grantAdmin request, the response contained the third flag.
