For the first level, we just navigated into the creds repository and used cat to get the creds. For the second level, we used the find command to get the repository with the creds, and then just printed it out. For the third level, we used grep to get the username and password from the text. For the fourth level, we ran chmod +x and then executed the script, which got us the creds. For the fifth level, we just used ls -a to find the creds. For the sixth level, we exited vim. For the seventh level, we used ps -eLf and greped our respective credentials from the list of commands. The seventh level was just another set of creds in a repository. For the eighth level, we navigated into the .git logs and found the password there. For the ninth and final level, we just read out the swap file, geting us the creds for hte penthouse.
